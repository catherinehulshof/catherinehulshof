### Hola

I lead the [Biodiversity Research Lab](https://biodiversityresearchlab.com/). 

The challenges facing science and society require integrative approaches that rely on high quality field data and quantitative techniques. We achieve this through the use of global ecological and environmental databases, large datasets that document long-term forest dynamics, datasets we generate ourselves, and open-source modelling tools. 

I also believe that collaboration and diverse perspectives lead to innovation and I support underrepresented minorities in biodiversity data science.
