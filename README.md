### Hola

I lead the [Biodiversity Research Lab](https://biodiversityresearchlab.com/). 

The challenges facing science and society require bold, innovative approaches that rely on high quality field data and quantitative techniques. I achieve this through the use of global ecological and environmental databases, large datasets that document long-term forest dynamics, datasets we generate ourselves, and open-source modelling tools. 

I believe that collaboration and diverse perspectives lead to innovation and I am an advocate for underrepresented minorities in biodiversity data science.
